	abstract = {The zinc transporter SLC30A8 is primarily expressed in islets of the endocrine pancreas. Human SLC30A8 loss-of-function mutations protect against type 2 diabetes. However, Slc30a8 knockout mice do not show this protection. We have generated a mouse model mimicking a common protective human SLC30A8 loss-of-function allele. This mouse model shows a beneficial effect of loss of SLC30A8 function on β-cell biology. In particular, mice carrying the protective R138X allele have an increased capacity to secrete insulin in high-glucose conditions. Understanding the signaling mechanisms regulating insulin secretion in the R138X mice could provide novel insights into β-cell biology, and may lead to the identification of therapeutic targets for the treatment of diabetes.SLC30A8 encodes a zinc transporter that is primarily expressed in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. In β-cells it transports zinc into insulin-containing secretory granules. Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in SLC30A8 protect against type 2 diabetes in humans. In this study, we generated a knockin mouse model carrying one of the most common human LOF mutations for SLC30A8, R138X. The R138X mice had normal body weight, glucose tolerance, and pancreatic β-cell mass. Interestingly, in hyperglycemic conditions induced by the insulin receptor antagonist S961, the R138X mice showed a 50\% increase in insulin secretion. This effect was not associated with enhanced β-cell proliferation or mass. Our data suggest that the SLC30A8 R138X LOF mutation may exert beneficial effects on glucose metabolism by increasing the capacity of β-cells to secrete insulin under hyperglycemic conditions.},
